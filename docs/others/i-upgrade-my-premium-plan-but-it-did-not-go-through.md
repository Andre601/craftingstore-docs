#I upgrade my premium plan but it did not go through

If you have upgraded your store to a higher plan, it might be the case that it is not processed instantly. If you have paid through PayPal, it might be because of a PayPal security check.

**What is this check?**  
PayPal puts the payment "On-Hold" for 24 hours to do a security check. We see the payment as "Oh-Hold" on our end, you will see it as completed.

**Why does this happen?**  
PayPal does this to make sure that you are the one that transferred the money, when the 24 hours pass, you will get the upgrade/renewal and the invoice.

**How often does this happen?**  
We see it a few times a week, we do not process payments that are not yet confirmed.

**What should I do?**  
Just wait, the payment will be processed after 24 hours if everything checks out. If it takes longer, contact us. If you need the plan right now, you can also create a support ticket, so we can give you a testing period of 10 days to bridge this time. When the payment passes, we will automatically apply it on to the existing days.
