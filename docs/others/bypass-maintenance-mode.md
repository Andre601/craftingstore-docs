#Bypass maintenance mode

As a store owner, you may want to view the store while its in maintenance mode. To view the store follow the steps below.

1\) Go to the webstore settings:   
2\) Enable maintenance mode.  
3\) On the left, you'll now find a "click here" link. This link contains a special token.  
4\) Click the link, you will be redirected to your store, and the store will set the bypass token in your browser.

The token is valid for 8 hours, you can renew it by clicking the link again. You can also share the link with others. They will only be able to bypass maintenance for this session. The token will reset every time you turn maintenance mode on/off.
