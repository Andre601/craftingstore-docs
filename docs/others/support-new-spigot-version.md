#Does CraftingStore support the new Spigot

Our plugin supports every Spigot version above and including 1.8. 

### Does it work on the version released just now?

The plugin was created to use as much general Java code as possible, that is also why the same plugin works on Spigot, Sponge, Bungee, and Velocity. The chance of a Spigot update breaking our plugin is very slim, as we only use basic features of the Spigot API. Our plugin was made for Spigot 1.12 and has not required any updates to fix issues that occurred after Spigot updates.
