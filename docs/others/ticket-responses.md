#See ticket replies

All ticket replies are done through email. If you created a ticket at our dashboard you will receive the response in your mailbox.

### Do I get a ticket creation confirmation?
We do not send email confirmation on ticket creation at this point in time.

### Can I see them through the dashboard?
No, tickets are only created through our dashboard, from there they are fully handled through email.

### How do I reply?
You can reply directly to the email, as long as you reply above the message, we will get it.

### How can I create a new ticket?
You have to use our dashboard, you can also email the support email, but your ticket will not include a signature that allows us to verify that you own the store, so we cannot help with any store specific issues unless the ticket has been created through our dashboard.
