#How does upgrading my plan work? Will I lose any days?

Let's say we have three plans;  
\- Plan 1: 10 EUR/month  
\- Plan 2: 20 EUR/month  
\- Plan 3: 30 EUR/month

And you are currently on plan 1, so you are paying 10 EUR/month and you want to upgrade to plan 2.

To do this, you simply go to the dashboard, select the new plan, and pay for the new plan. You are paying the full price, but we are re-calculating your existing days. It will work like this;  
  
In this scenario we will presum that you had 10 days left on "Plan 1" before upgrading. What our system will give you is the following;  
\- 1 month worth of Plan 2, because you paid the full price.  
\- The recalculated plan 1 days, in plan 2 days. Plan 2 is twice as expensive, so we will cut the days in halve (5 days)

This means, that you will end up with 36 days left on plan 2.

You won't lose any money, or days. We automatically re-calculate them to match the new pricing. The reason we are doing this are;  
\- It prevents users from up &amp; downgrading on-demand - Abusing the system  
\- It helps with bookkeeping, so even if users up/downgrade their plans, we still have our 3 packages in our bookkeeping. Not pro-rated packages, or packages with strange prices.
