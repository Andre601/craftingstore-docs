#Packages are not added to the basket

In some cases, packages will not be added to the basket, this happens because they reached a limit that you've set in the package settings.

Make sure that the package does not have any limits like "Global Limit" or "User Limit" enabled. You can change these settings from the package editor, on the first tab.
