#How do I create a custom menu?

With our custom menu's feature on our Gold plan, you can create menu's in any layout you like. You can drag &amp; drop packages, categories, or items, to their desired place.

### How do I create a new page

You can open the CraftingStore dashboard, and go to \[ Sidebar -&gt; Webstore -&gt; Plugin menu \]. Here you can see the existing pages, and create new ones. When opening, or creating a new page, you can simply drag &amp; drop the packages and/or categories into their place.

When you have multiple pages, you can link pages to each other by dragging a "menu" item to the inventory. With this, you can create complex menu's.

### How do I enable the menu?

By default, the normal menu is shown. To use your customized menu, you'll have to enable it. You can enable it by opening the CraftingStore dashboard, and then go to \[ Sidebar -&gt; Settings -&gt; Plugin menu \]. Here you can set the "Enable Fully Customized Inventories" to "Yes" and select the "Start inventory".
