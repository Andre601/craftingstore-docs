#Global Commands

You can create "Global commands" for your whole store, these commands will run on all or a section of servers when any package is bought.

### What placeholders can I use?
You can use all placeholders that you can normally use: ([See placeholders](/general/what-placeholders-can-i-use))

### Can I specify on what servers commands should run?
Yes! You can select "All servers selected for package". This will execute the command(s) on the servers you have selected for the package. Or you can specify a specific server. For example, your BungeeCord proxy to do an alert.
