#Two-factor Authentication

Two factor authentication is required on CraftingStore. There are two types.

### Email
When you do not configure any two factor authentication we will email you every time you try to get in from an unknown location.

### OTP
You can also use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc. if you prefer that. You can enable OTP Two-Factor authentication through your profile.
