#E-mail receipt

E-mail receipts are E-mails that we send to your customers when they buy a package. This receipt can be used as a payment confirmation, so they can store it, or give you proof of payment.

### How to enable E-mail receipts?
1\. Go to your CraftingStore panel.   
2\. Click on the "Settings" tab in the sidebar.  
3\. Select "Webstore"  
4\. Set "E-mail receipt" to "Yes" and update the settings.

### Can I change the HTML in my receipt?
Yes you can, but Silver or higher is required. The email receipts are stored along with your template. You can modify it by going to [ Design -> Templates -> Your template (create one if you don't have one) -> "emails/receipt.twig" ]
