#Coupon codes

Coupon codes give you the ability to create discount codes for your server. You can use this feature to give your customers a "NEWYEAR" discount on your store.

### Configuration for coupons
There are lots of options that you can configure for your coupons. Below all options are described.

#### Type Discount
The type can be either "amount" or "percentage". Amount means that you specify a number, and the buyer will get that amount as the discount. Percentage will be a percentage (e.g. 50%).

#### Max uses
The option allows you to specify how many times this coupon can be used in global. If you set this to 10, the coupon code may be used 10 times by all users in total. If 10 users used it, the 11th cannot use it anymore.

#### Coupon behavior
There are two options, "override sales" or "stack on top (after)". The override sale option will ignore the sale. If there is a 50% off sale running, and your coupon code is for 10% off. The total price will be just the 10% off. The "stack on top (after)" option will stack them. First it will take the sale percentage (50% in this example). It will then take the price and subtract 10% from that amount. The result will be the final price.

#### Discount behavior
The discount can either apply to packages, or to the total price at the end.

#### Apply coupon to
Here you can select exactly where the coupon should work. You can select: Whole store, specific categories, or specific packages.

#### Start & End date
The coupon can also be enabled & disabled automatically based on the provided dates. For example, when you are doing an action at a specific holiday.
