#How to set up PayPal (Legacy/Personal)

We offer PayPal as a direct gateway to our platform. Setting up PayPal on your CraftingStore account is easy to do in a few steps. The following guide works for (most) personal accounts, and Business accounts. This method will use PayPal's payment button system.   
  
1\. Go to CraftingStore, and select "payments" -&gt; "gateways" from the sidebar.   
2\. Enter your PayPal mail and set "Enabled PayPal" to yes.   
3\. Make sure that you select "Legacy" as the type.  
4\. Make sure that your PayPal account has IPN (Instant payment notifications) enabled (see below)  
5\. Save the settings.
