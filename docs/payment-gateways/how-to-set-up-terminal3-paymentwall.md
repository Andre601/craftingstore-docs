#How to set up Terminal3 (Paymentwall)

To set-up PaymentWall, you will need a LIVE application on Paymentwall. You can create one, and contact the support with your business model so they can activate your account.

If you need to test the IPN you can set the "uid" field to "test", this will validate your payment.

When your project is **LIVE** you can follow these steps;   
  
1\. Open your project.   
2\. Change the "pingback URL" to **https://api.craftingstore.net/callback/terminal3**  
3\. Change the "Pingback signature version" to **2**.  
4\. Open the gateways page (gateways at the sidebar).   
5\. Enter the project's app and secret key on this page.   
6\. You can use Paymentwall now, to accept payments!
