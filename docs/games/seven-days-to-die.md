#7 Days to Die

We have a plugin for the uMod/Oxide mod platform. You can use this plugin to execute commands. 

### How to Install the plugin?
The installation will be like any other plugin that you might already have. We assume that you already created a server for the "Oxide/uMod" type at our dashboard [ Webstore -> Servers ] and that you have your API token ready (can be found at the servers page).

1. Download the CraftingStore plugin, you can find it at the "Servers" section in the right top corner.
2. Upload the CraftingStore.cs into the /oxide/plugins folder, like any other plugin.
3. The plugin now created a config (/oxide/config/CraftingStore.json).
4. Get the token from our servers page put it in the configuration.
5. Restart the server or reload the plugin.
