#SSL Certificates

We offer the ability to request an SSL certificate for your website (on silver and higher). This can help you boost the sales, and every player will see a green lock in the URL bar.   
  
**What is SSL?**  
SSL is a secure way of connecting to a website. You know that a site is using SSL (HTTPS) when the lock in the URL bar is green, this means that the connection to the website is encrypted.   
  
**How does it work?**  
We use Let's Encrypt certificates to make your store work using HTTPS, we generate these certificates on your behave and place them on some of our edge servers.

**How do I enable HTTPS?**  
Please refer to our F.A.Q. an item about the set-up: [**Click here**](/general/set-up-ssl-certificates-for-your-store).

**Can I redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS?**   
Yes, you can! Just go to your CraftingStore dashboard, and look for Settings -&gt; Domain. This page contains the option to forward all HTTP traffic.
