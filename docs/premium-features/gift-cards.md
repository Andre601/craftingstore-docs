#Gift cards

**Gift cards**  
A gift card is used to give players "credit" for your webshop. You can generate a unique key within the dashboard, and the player can use this key to get a discount, or to get the package for free (depends on the amount chosen by you).   
  
**Features:**  
\- The gift card has a fixed amount, the player can redeem this in parts.   
\- If the package is worth more than the gift card, the amount will be taken from the card, and the rest can be paid by another gateway (real money).   
\- You can see all the cards, and the balance left on them.
