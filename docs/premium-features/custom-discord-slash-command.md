#Custom Discord Slash Command

With silver and up you can configure a custom command for users to claim their roles on your Discord server, it will still use our bot, but you can change the command. If you change the bot name, it is almost fully hidden to the user.

1. Go to [ Webstore -> Servers ].  
2. Click "set-up" at your Discord server. We assume that you configured it. If not, please follow the "Set-up Discord server" guide.
3. Here you should see the options;    

**Custom slash command:**   
This is the command that users will type (entering "testcommand" will result in "/testcommand").    

**Custom slash command - Description**  
If the user types this command, this will be the description.   

**Custom slash command parameter**  
This will be parameter shown that they have to enter. The player received their claim code in their email. So you can name this something like "token". 

**Custom slash command parameter description**  
Describe what the user should enter (e.g. "The code you received in your email")

**Not seeing your new slash command?**  
Please try to re-invite our bot using the link in our "Discord integration" article: https://help.craftingstore.net/general/discord-integration. The bot needs the "Commands" scope. If you invited the bot before september, 2021, it does not have that access. So we cannot create custom slash commands on your server. The new invite link does include it.
