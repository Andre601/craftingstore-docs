#My sales do not apply.

Sales are applied to the selected categories, packages or the whole store. But they will only show if they are enabled, in this post we describe some settings that might make your sales not go live.

**You are using an old template**  
Some old templates (3th party) do not yet have the required changes for the pricing system, upgrade your template or ask support.

**The category has "cumulative packages" enabled.**   
The cumulative packages feature has an option to discard sales (this is the default), so if the user bought their rank with a discount, it would give the user the full price back in value.

You can change this by going to the category and editing it, make sure "Should cumulative category respect sales?" is checked.

**The package or category is not selected.**  
Sometimes, the item that you are viewing is not selected in the sale settings, make sure it is.
