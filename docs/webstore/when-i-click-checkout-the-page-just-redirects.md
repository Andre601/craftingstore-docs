#When I click checkout the page just redirects

When you click checkout at the store, we will create a payment for your store and redirect the customer. But it might happen that the page just refreshes. The biggest cause of this that no gateways are set-up.

**How to set-up a payment gateway?**  
1\. Go to the CraftingStore dashboard.  
2\. Go to \[ Payments -&gt; Gateways \]  
3\. Configure any gateway of choice. Make sure to click "Update Gateways" at the top or bottom, just closing the box is not enough.  
  
How the store should function as expected.
