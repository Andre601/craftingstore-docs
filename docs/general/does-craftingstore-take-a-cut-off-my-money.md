#Does CraftingStore take a cut off my money?

When doing payments online, there are always fees, as that is how payment providers make money.

### Does CraftingStore charge transaction fees?
We do not, our income comes from stores upgrading to our premium plans, not from taking a cut.

### Who does take fees?
Any payment provider, like: PayPal, Stripe, Mollie, etc. They all take a cut.

### How much are the fees from payment providers?
That is hard to say, it depends. PayPal charges different fees based on where the buyer is from, what currency they use, and what rate you have. The same is true for other payment providers, like Stripe.
