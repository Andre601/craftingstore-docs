#How to create a package

Categories are used to store packages. They add structure to your store. You can have a category named "Kits" with only kits.

1\. Open the dashboard at CraftingStore.net ([click](https://craftingstore.net))  
2\. Click "Packages" in the sidebar of the panel.   
3\. Click "New package" at the right top.   
  
Now, we are on the create page. We have a lot of options. This guide will explain all of them.
