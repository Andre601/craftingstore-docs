#How do I create a sub-category?

Sub-categories are categories that fall under a normal category. They will be available in the dropdown on your shop.

1\. Create the main category by going to the categories page on the dashboard, and click "Create Category", this will be the category that shows in the menu.  
2\. Go to the categories page again, and click "Create category" again.  
3\. Switch the option "Should this category have a parent category?" to "On"  
4\. Select the main category you created before.  
  
Now this newly created category will be a sub-category of the first one.
