#How to enable the Coupon/Giftcard box.

By default, the coupon and discount box is disabled. But we can enable it in a few easy steps.   
  
1\. Go to the CraftingStore dashboard, and click "Settings -&gt; Webshop" from the sidebar ([or click here](https://craftingstore.net/admin/settings/webstore)).   
2\. Look for "Discount".   
3\. Set the select box to "Yes".   
4\. Now the store will update, and the customers will find a discount &amp; giftcard box (those are the same) on the checkout page.
