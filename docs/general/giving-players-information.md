#Giving players information

Some games have specific rules before you can sell items within their games. These are some examples, and how you can do it. Please always check the requirements yourself, this is not legal advice, nor is it a complete set of rules. This article only exists to help you finding the right information.

### I have to state that I'm a third party
When you run a third-party server or store, it MUST be clear to the player that you are not affiliated with the game publisher. This includes clearly stating that you are not associated with the publisher and that support enqueries should not go to the game publisher, but to you instead.

### I have to give players access to their payment history
We offer a system where players can view their payment history for all stores that they ever bought something on through CraftingStore. Please provide your customrs with a link to this system if you are required to. The link is: https://example.craftingstore.net/history - Replace "example.craftingstore.net" with your own domain.
