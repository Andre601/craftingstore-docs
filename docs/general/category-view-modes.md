#Category view modes

Categories can have one of two view modes, we will describe both here.

**List view**  
The list view mode will show a list of packages, it will not contain any images (even if you upload them).

**Grid view**  
The grid view will show images, all packages will be shown as a big box next to each other. If you have images for your packages, grid view is the way to go.
