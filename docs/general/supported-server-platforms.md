#Supported server platforms

We currently support multiple server platforms with our plugin, please read below to find out.

**CraftBukkit/Spigot**  
Our plugin supports CraftBukkit, Spigot and related forks like PaperSpigot. This plugin allows you to execute commands in the game when a player buys a package.  
  
**BungeeCord**  
A bungeecord proxy is used to link together multiple Spigot servers, our plugin allows you to run commands on the proxy itself   
when somebody buys a package, you can, for example, alert the purchase on the whole network.

**Velocity** Velocity is a proxy that can be used to link multiple servers together. Its an alternative to Bungeecord. **Oxide/uMod** Our Oxide mod allows your Rust server to run commands that are configured. **Sponge**  
Our plugin has full support for SpongePowered servers.

**RCON &amp; RCON Web**  
We offer support for RCON connected servers, this feature does not require any plugins. Every minecraft server (even vanilla), and lots of other game servers (like Rust) have support for this method.
