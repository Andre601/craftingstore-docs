#What are player profiles?

A player profile is a confirmation that you own a specific E-mail address or Minecraft UUID.

Because CraftingStore stores personal data, and we are required by law to allow users to redact their data we created "Player profiles".

A player profile allows you to see all payments created by your specific E-mail address, you can view the data and redact any data that we have on you. The store owner will see the payments as "redacted".
