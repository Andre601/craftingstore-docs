#Where can I submit suggestions?

You can create suggestions through our suggestions board at GitHub. Please look here: [github.com/CraftingStore/Suggestions](https://github.com/CraftingStore/Suggestions)

Select “issues”, and open up the “New issue” block. Here you can choose the template you want to use.
