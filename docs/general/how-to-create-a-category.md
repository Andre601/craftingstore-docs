#How to create a category

Categories are used to store packages. They add structure to your store. You can have a category named "Kits" with only kits.

1\. Open the dashboard at CraftingStore.net ([click](https://craftingstore.net))  
2\. Click "Categories" in the sidebar of the panel.   
3\. Click "New category" at the right top.   
4\. Enter a name.  
5\. Click save.  
  
The category will not show on the store.
