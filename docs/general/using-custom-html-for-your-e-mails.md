#Using custom HTML for your E-mails

With our silver plan, you can modify the e-mail template. This will modify the HTML. The store will use the active template and look for the "receipt.html".

Some servers want more control and want to change the mail as a whole (not just the content).

For this, we created an extra option named "Full receipt override using template" it is located under \[ Design -&gt; Settings \]. If you enable this, we do not show our template at all, and it will use only the content from your template.
