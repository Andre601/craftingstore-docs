#Can I run commands when a player charges back their money?

Yes, you can create a command for each package, just select the “Charge-back” option and the command will only run when a player charges their money back.

It is not possible for us to automatically revert commands like ranks, as those commands differ for each plugin.

Tip: If you want to ban the player if they charge-back, you can also create a global command instead of adding it to all of the packages individually.
